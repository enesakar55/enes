"character","dialogues"
"MAN ","Yeah"
"WOMAN ","Is everything in place?"
"TRINITY","I said, is everything in place?"
"CYPHER","You weren't supposed to relieve me."
"TRINITY","I know but I felt like taking a shift."
"CYPHER","You like him, don't you?  You like watching him?"
"TRINITY","Don't be ridiculous."
"CYPHER","We're going to kill him.Do you understand that? He's going to die just like the others."
"TRINITY","Morpheus believes he is the One."
"CYPHER","Do you?"
"TRINITY","I... it doesn't matter what I believe."
"CYPHER","You don't, do you?"
"TRINITY","If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus."
"CYPHER","I intend to, believe me. Someone has to."
"TRINITY","Did you hear that?"
"CYPHER","Hear what?"
"TRINITY","Are you sure this line is clean?"
"CYPHER","Yeah, 'course I'm sure."
"TRINITY","I better go."
"BIG COP","Police!  Freeze!"
"BIG COP","Hands behind your head!  Now!  Do it!"
"AGENT SMITH","Lieutenant?"
"LIEUTENANT","Oh shit."
"AGENT SMITH","Lieutenant, you were given specific orders "
"LIEUTENANT","I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass."
"AGENT SMITH","The orders were for your protection."
"LIEUTENANT","I think we can handle one little girl."
"LIEUTENANT","I sent two units.They're bringing her down now."
"AGENT SMITH","No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead."
"TRINITY","Shit."
"MAN","Operator."
"TRINITY","Morpheus!  The line was traced!I don't know how."
"MORPHEUS","I know.  They cut the hardline.This line is not a viable exit."
"TRINITY","Are they any agent?"
"MORPHEUS","Yes."
"TRINITY","Goddamnit!"
"MORPHEUS","You have to focus.  There is a phone. Wells and Lake.  You can make it.She takes a deep breath, centering herself"
"TRINITY","All right "
"MORPHEUS","Go."
"COP","Mutherfucker -- that's impossible!"
"TRINITY","Get up, Trinity.  You're fine.  Get up -- just get up!"
"AGENT JONES","Then the informant is real."
"AGENT SMITH","Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable."
"AGENT JONES","He'll be contacting us again."
"AGENT SMITH","Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?"
"AGENT JONES","Their next target.  The name is Neo."
"AGENT SMITH","We'll need a search running."
"AGENT JONES","It's already begun."
"NEO","What...?"
"NEO","What the hell?"
"NEO","Who is it?"
"CHOI","It's Choi"
"NEO","You're two hours late."
"CHOI","I know.  It's her fault."
"NEO","You got the money?"
"CHOI","Two grand."
"NEO","Hold on."
"CHOI","Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man!My own personal Jesus Christ!"
"NEO","If you get caught using that --"
"CHOI","I know, I know. This never happened.  You don't exist."
"NEO","Right..."
"CHOI","Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual."
"NEO","I don't know... My computer..."
"NEO","You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?"
"CHOI","All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly."
"CHOI","It sounds to me like you need to unplug, man.  A little R and R.What do you think, Dujour, should we take him with us?"
"DUJOUR (GIRLFRIEND)","Definitely."
"NEO","I can't.  I have to work tomorrow."
"DUJOUR","Come on.  It'll be fun.  I promise."
"NEO","Yeah, yeah.  Sure, I'll go."
"TRINITY","Hello, Neo."
"NEO","How do you know that name?"
"TRINITY","I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time."
"NEO","Who are you?"
"TRINITY","My name is Trinity."
"NEO","Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?"
"TRINITY","That was a long time ago."
"NEO","Gee-zus."
"TRINITY","What?"
"NEO","I just thought... you were a guy."
"TRINITY","Most guys do."
"NEO","Do you want to go somewhere and talk?"
"TRINITY","No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time."
"NEO","That was you on my computer?"
"NEO","How did you do that?"
"TRINITY","Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you."
"NEO","Of what?"
"TRINITY","They're watching you, Neo."
"NEO","Who is?"
"TRINITY","Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends,why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him."
"TRINITY","I know because I came looking for the same thing, but when he found me he told me I wasn't really looking for him.  I was looking for an answer."
"TRINITY","It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question."
"NEO","What is the Matrix?"
"TRINITY","When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it."
"TRINITY","The answer is out there, Neo.  It's looking for you and it will find you, if you want it to."
"NEO","Shit shit shit."
"RHINEHEART","You have a problem with authority,Mr. Anderson.  You believe that you are special, that somehow the rules do not apply to you."
"RHINEHEART","Obviously, you are mistaken."
"RHINEHEART","This company is one of the top software companies in the World because every single employee understands that they are part of a whole.  Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem."
"RHINEHEART","The time has come to make a choice,Mr. Anderson.  Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth, or you choose to find yourself another job.  Do I make myself clear?"
"NEO","Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly clear."
"VOICE","Thomas Anderson?"
"NEO","Yeah.  That's me."
"FEDEX MAN","Have a nice day."
"NEO","Hello?"
"MORPHEUS","Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?"
"NEO","Morpheus..."
"MORPHEUS","I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time. They're coming for you, Neo.And I'm not sure what they're going to do."
"NEO","Who's coming for me?"
"MORPHEUS","Stand up and see for yourself."
"NEO","Right now?"
"MORPHEUS","Yes.  Now."
"MORPHEUS","Do it slowly.  The elevator."
"NEO","Holy fucking shit!"
"MORPHEUS","Yes."
"NEO","What the fuck do they want with me?"
"MORPHEUS","I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there."
"NEO","How?"
"MORPHEUS","I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say."
"MORPHEUS","The cubicle across from you is empty."
"NEO","But what if...?"
"MORPHEUS","Go!  Now!"
"MORPHEUS","Stay here for a moment."
"MORPHEUS","A little longer..."
"MORPHEUS","When I tell you, go to the end of the row to the first office on the left, stay as low as you can."
"MORPHEUS","Now."
"MORPHEUS","Good.  Now there is a window. Open it."
"NEO","How do you know all this?"
"MORPHEUS","The answer is coming, Neo."
"MORPHEUS (V.O.)","Outside, there's a scaffold.  You can use it to get to the roof"
"NEO","No!  It's too far away."
"MORPHEUS ","There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it."
"NEO","No way, no way, this is crazy."
"MORPHEUS ","There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody. You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you."
"NEO","This is insane!  Why is this happening to me?  What did I do? I'm nobody.  I didn't do anything.Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!"
"NEO","I'm going to die."
"NEO","This is insane!  I can't do this!Forget it!"
"NEO","I didn't do anything!"
"TRINITY","Shit."
"AGENT SMITH","As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson."
"AGENT SMITH","It seems that you have been living two lives.  In one life, you are Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company.You have a social security number,you pay your taxes and you help your landlady carry out her garbage."
"AGENT SMITH","The other life is lived in computers where you go by the hacker alias Neo, and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for."
"AGENT SMITH","One of these lives has a future.One of them does not."
"AGENT SMITH","I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are here because we need your help."
"AGENT SMITH","We know that you have been contacted by a certain individual.  A man who calls himself Morpheus.  Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant to the fact that he is wanted for acts of terrorism in more countries than any other man in the world.  He is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive."
"AGENT SMITH","My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you but I believe you want to do the right thing.  It is obvious that you are an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson,and that you are interested in the future.  That is why I believe you are ready to put your past mistakes behind you and get on with your life"
"AGENT SMITH","We are willing to wipe the slate clean, to give you a fresh start and all we are asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice."
"NEO","Yeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a real good deal.  But I think I have a better one.  How about I give you the finger "
"NEO","And you can cram that file up your Secret Service sphincter."
"AGENT SMITH","You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson."
"NEO","You can't scare me with Gestapo crap.  I know my rights.  I want my phone call!"
"AGENT SMITH","And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what good is a phone call if you are unable to speak?"
"AGENT SMITH","You are going to help us, Mr.Anderson, whether you want to or not."
"MORPHEUS (V.O.)","This line is tapped so I must be brief."
"NEO","The agents --"
"MORPHEUS (V.O.)","They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead."
"NEO","What do you know?"
"MORPHEUS (V.O.)","You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you."
"MORPHEUS (V.O.)","Do you still want to meet?"
"NEO","Yes."
"MORPHEUS (V.O.)","Go the the Adams Street bridge."
"TRINITY","Get in."
"NEO","What the hell is this?"
"TRINITY","It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection."
"NEO","From what?"
"TRINITY","From you."
"SWITCH","Take off your shirt."
"NEO","What?  Why?"
"SWITCH","Stop the car."
"SWITCH","Listen to me, coppertop!  We don't have time for 'twenty questions.' Right now there is only one rule.Our way or the highway."
"NEO","Fine."
"TRINITY","No, we can't let him go "
"TRINITY","Neo, please, you have to trust me."
"NEO","Why?"
"TRINITY"," Because you've been down there, Neo.You already know that road.You know exactly where it ends."
"TRINITY","And I know that's not where you want to be."
"NEO","... shit"
"TRINITY","Lie back."
"NEO","What is this thing?"
"TRINITY","We think you're bugged.  Try to relax."
"TRINITY","Come on, come on..."
"TRINITY","Got it."
"NEO","Got what?  My spleen?"
"TRINITY","This is it."
"TRINITY","Let me give one piece of advice.  Be honest.  He knows more than you can possibly imagine."
"MORPHEUS","At last"
"MORPHEUS","Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus."
"NEO","It's an honor."
"MORPHEUS","Please.  Come.  Sit."
"MORPHEUS","Thank you, Trinity."
"MORPHEUS","I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?"
"NEO","You could say that."
"MORPHEUS","I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up."
"MORPHEUS","Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?"
"NEO","You're Morpheus, you're a legend.Most hackers would die to meet you."
"MORPHEUS","Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that. Do you believe in fate, Neo?"
"NEO","No."
"MORPHEUS","Why not?"
"NEO","Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life."
"MORPHEUS","I know exactly what you mean."
"MORPHEUS","Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something. What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?"
"NEO","The Matrix?"
"MORPHEUS","Do you want to know what it is?"
"MORPHEUS","The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the World that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth."
"NEO","What truth?"
"MORPHEUS","That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind."
"MORPHEUS","Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is.  You have to see it for yourself."
"MORPHEUS","This is your last chance.  After this, there is no going back.  You take the blue pill and the story ends.  You wake in your bed and you believe whatever you want to believe."
"MORPHEUS","You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."
"MORPHEUS","Remember that all I am offering is the truth.  Nothing more."
"MORPHEUS","Follow me."
"MORPHEUS","Apoc, are we on-line?"
"APOC","Almost."
"MORPHEUS","Neo, time is always against us.Will you take a seat there?"
"NEO","You did all this?"
"MORPHEUS","The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location"
"NEO","What does that mean?"
"CYPHER","It means buckle up, Dorothy, 'cause Kansas is going bye-bye."
"NEO","Shit..."
"MORPHEUS","Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?"
"NEO","This can't be..."
"MORPHEUS","Be what?  Be real?"
"MORPHEUS","What if you were unable to wake from that dream, Neo?  How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"
"NEO","Uh-oh..."
"TRINITY","It's going into replication."
"MORPHEUS","Apoc?"
"APOC","Still nothing."
"MORPHEUS","Tank, we're going to need the signal soon."
"NEO","It's cold."
"NEO","It's all over me --"
"TRINITY","I got a fibrillation!"
"MORPHEUS","Shit!  Apoc?"
"APOC","Targeting... almost there."
"TRINITY","He's going into arrest!"
"APOC","Lock!  I got him!"
"MORPHEUS","Now, Tank, now!"
"MORPHEUS","Welcome to the real world, Neo."
"MORPHEUS ","We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him."
"TRINITY","What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?"
"NEO ","... am I dead?"
"MORPHEUS","Far from it."
"DOZER","He needs a lot of work."
"MORPHEUS","I know."
"NEO","What are you doing?"
"MORPHEUS","Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them."
"NEO","Why do my eyes hurt?"
"MORPHEUS","You've never used them before."
"MORPHEUS","Rest, Neo.  The answers are coming."
"NEO","Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?"
"MORPHEUS","More important than what is when?"
"NEO","When?"
"MORPHEUS","You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know."
"MORPHEUS","There is no reason for me to try to explain it when I can simple Show it.  Come with me."
"MORPHEUS","This is my ship, the Nebuchadnezzar.It's a hovercraft.  Small like a submarine.  It's cramped and cold.But it's home."
"MORPHEUS","This is the main deck.  You know most of my crew."
"MORPHEUS","The ones you don't know.  That's Mouse, Cypher, and Switch.  The two big guys are Tank and Dozer."
"MORPHEUS","And this, this is the Core.  This is where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix."
"MORPHEUS","You want to know what the Matrix is, Neo?  The answer is right here."
"MORPHEUS","Help him, Trinity."
"MORPHEUS","This will feel a little weird."
"MORPHEUS","This is the Construct."
"MORPHEUS","It is our loading program.  We can load anything from clothes, to weapons, to training simulations. Anything we need."
"MORPHEUS","Sit down."
"NEO","Right now, we're inside a computer program?"
"MORPHEUS","Wild, isn't it?"
"NEO","This isn't real?"
"MORPHEUS","What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain."
"MORPHEUS","This is the Chicago you know. Chicago as it was at the end of the Twentieth Century.  This Chicago exists only as part of a neural- interactive simulation that we call the Matrix."
"MORPHEUS","You have been living inside a dreamworld, Neo.  As in Baudrillard's vision, your whole life has been spent inside the map, not the territory.  This is Chicago as it exists today."
"MORPHEUS","'The desert of the real"
"MORPHEUS","The average temperature in Chicago these days is minus eighty degrees Celsius.  Of course, the wind chill makes it feel like minus one-twenty."
"MORPHEUS","We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I."
"NEO","A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?"
"MORPHEUS","Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny."
"MORPHEUS","We don't know who struck first.  Us or them.  But we do know it was us that scorched the sky.  At the time, they were dependent on solar power. It was believed they would be unable to survive without an energy source as abundant as the sun."
"MORPHEUS","Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive.  Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony."
"MORPHEUS","The Machines discovered a new form of fusion.  All they needed was a small electrical charge to initiate the reaction."
"MORPHEUS","The human body generates more bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s of body heat."
"MORPHEUS","For the longest time, I wouldn't believe it.  But then I saw the fields with my own eyes, spreading in every direction for miles. Inside the power plant, I watched them liquefy the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living and standing there, facing the efficiency, the pure, horrifying precision, I came to realize the obviousness of the truth."
"MORPHEUS","What is the Matrix?  Control."
"MORPHEUS","The Matrix is a computer-generated dreamworld built to keep us under control in order to change a human being into this."
"NEO","No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!"
"MORPHEUS","I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth."
"NEO","Stop!  Let me out!  I want out!"
"NEO","Get this thing out of me!"
"TRINITY","Easy, Neo.  Easy."
"NEO","Don't touch me!  Get away from me!"
"NEO","I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!"
"CYPHER","He's going to pop!"
"NEO","I can't go back, can I?"
"MORPHEUS","No.  But if you could, would you really want to?"
"MORPHEUS","I feel that I owe you an apology. There is a rule that we do not free a mind once it reaches a certain age.  It is dangerous.  They have trouble letting go.  Their mind turns against them.  I've seen it happen.  I broke the rule because I had to."
"MORPHEUS","When the Matrix was first built there was a man born inside that had the ability to change what he wanted, to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.  It was this man that freed the first of us and taught us the secret of the war; control the Matrix and you control the future."
"MORPHEUS","When he died, the Oracle prophesied his return and envisioned an end to the war and freedom for our people. That is why there are those of us that have spent our entire lives searching the Matrix, looking for him."
"MORPHEUS","I did what I did because I believe the search is over."
"MORPHEUS","Get some rest.  You're going to need it."
"NEO","For what?"
"MORPHEUS","Your training."
"TANK","Morning.  Did you sleep?"
"NEO","No."
"TANK","You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator."
"NEO","You don't have..."
"TANK","Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion."
"NEO","Zion?"
"TANK","If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be."
"NEO","It's a city?"
"TANK","The last human city.  The only place we got left."
"NEO","Where is it?"
"TANK","Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it."
"TANK","Goddamn, I got to tell you, I'm fairly excited to see what you are capable of.  I mean if Morpheus is right and all.  We're not supposed to talk about any of that but if you are, well then this is an exciting time.  We got a lot to do, so let's get to it."
"TANK","We're supposed to load all these operations programs first, but this is some major boring shit.  Why don't we start with something a little fun?"
"TANK","How about some combat training?"
"NEO","Jujitsu?  I'm going to learn jujitsu?"
"NEO","No way."
"NEO","Holy shit!"
"TANK","Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?"
"NEO","Hell yes!"
"MORPHEUS","How is he?"
"TANK","Ten hours straight.  He's a machine."
"NEO","This is incredible.  I know kung fu"
"MORPHEUS","Show me."
"MORPHEUS","This is a sparring program, similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix.  It has the same basic rules.  Rules like gravity.  What you must learn is that these rules are no different than the rules of a computer system.  Some of them can be bent.  Others can be broken."
"MORPHEUS","Attack me."
"MOUSE","Morpheus is fighting Neo!"
"MORPHEUS","Good.  Adaptation.  Improvisation. But your weakness isn't your technique."
"MORPHEUS","How did I beat you?"
"NEO","You -- you're too fast."
"MORPHEUS","Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?"
"MORPHEUS","Do you believe that's air you are breathing now?"
"MORPHEUS","Again."
"MOUSE","Jeeezus Keeerist!  That boy is fast!"
"MORPHEUS","Come on, Neo.  What are you waiting for?  You're faster than this. Don't think you are.  Know you are."
"MORPHEUS","Come on!  Stop trying to hit me and just hit me."
"MOUSE","I don't believe it!"
"NEO","I know what you're trying to do"
"MORPHEUS","I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program."
"MORPHEUS","Let it all go, Neo.  Fear.  Doubt. Disbelief.  Free your mind."
"NEO","Shit"
"NEO","Okie dokie.  Free my mind.  Right. No problem."
"SWITCH","He's gonna make it."
"APOC","No way.  Not possible."
"MOUSE","No one's ever made their first jump."
"SWITCH","What if he does?"
"APOC","He won't."
"TRINITY","Come on."
"MORPHEUS","Do you know why you didn't make it?"
"NEO","Because... I didn't think I would?"
"MOUSE","What does it mean?"
"SWITCH","It doesn't mean anything."
"CYPHER","Everyone falls the first time, right, Trinity?"
"NEO","I thought it wasn't real."
"MORPHEUS","Your mind makes it real."
"NEO","If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?"
"MORPHEUS","The body cannot live without the mind."
"TRINITY","Neo, I saved you some dinner --"
"CYPHER","I don't remember you ever bringing me dinner."
"CYPHER","There's something about him, isn't there?"
"TRINITY","Don't tell me you're a believer now?"
"CYPHER","I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know."
"TRINITY","Morpheus will take him when he's ready."
"MORPHEUS","This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson."
"NEO","What -- what lesson?"
"MORPHEUS","The Matrix is a system, Neo, and that system is our enemy.  When you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, lawyers, students. People.  Everywhere you look, there are people.  Somewhere else, somewhere in the future they may be human beings but here these people are a part of the system.  That makes every one of them our enemy."
"MORPHEUS ","It is important to understand that if you are not one of us, you are one of them."
"MORPHEUS","Do you understand, Neo?"
"NEO","I think I do."
"MORPHEUS ","No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?"
"NEO","Yeah"
"MORPHEUS","Look again."
"MORPHEUS","Freeze it."
"MORPHEUS","The agents are sentient programs. They can enter any software that is hardwired to the system.  They can become anyone who is still a captive of the Matrix.  If the Matrix is a prison, then the agents are its wardens and if humankind is to survive they first must be stopped."
"MORPHEUS","Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change."
"NEO","How?"
"MORPHEUS","I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be."
"NEO","What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?"
"MORPHEUS","No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to."
"TANK ","We got trouble."
"MORPHEUS","How much time, Dozer?"
"DOZER","I estimate we'll be within range of detection in about two minutes."
"MORPHEUS","Set down in there."
"NEO","What's going on?"
"DOZER","Squiddy tripped one of our long distance alarm probes."
"NEO","What?"
"TRINITY","A Sentinel.  It's a killing machine designed for one thing."
"DOZER","Search and destroy"
"TANK","Done"
"TANK","Power off-line.  E.M.P. armed and ready."
"NEO","E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse."
"TRINITY","It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines."
"MORPHEUS","Don't move.  It'll hear you."
"CYPHER","Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me."
"NEO","Sorry"
"CYPHER","No, it's all right."
"NEO","What are you doing?"
"CYPHER","Midnight watch."
"NEO","Is that...?"
"CYPHER","The Matrix?  Yeah."
"NEO","	Do you always look at it encoded?"
"CYPHER","Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?"
"CYPHER","You know, I know what you're thinking 'cause right now I'm thinking the same thing.  Actually, to tell you the truth, I've been thinking the same thing ever since I got here."
"CYPHER","Why the fuck didn't I take that blue pill!?"
"CYPHER","Good shit, eh?  Dozer makes it. It's good for two things: degreasing engines and killing brain cells."
"CYPHER","Can I ask you something?  Did he happen to tell you why he did it?"
"CYPHER","Why you're here?"
"NEO","Yeah"
"CYPHER","Gee-zus!  What a mindfuck.  You're here to save the world.  You gotta be shitting me.  What do you say to something like that?"
"CYPHER","I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One."
"NEO","Really"
"CYPHER","You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going."
"NEO","How many were there?"
"CYPHER","Five.  Since I've been here"
"NEO","What happened to them?"
"CYPHER","Dead.  All dead."
"NEO","How?"
"CYPHER","Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off."
"CYPHER","Look, I'm not trying to spook you, I just want to help and I'm not going to bullshit you.  See, this is the real world and the real world ain't about heroes and miracles.  This world's about one thing:  survival. That's all there is."
"NEO","Thanks... for the drink."
"CYPHER","Any time."
"CYPHER","Sweet dreams"
"TANK","Here you go, buddy.  Over easy, right?"
"APOC","Breakfast of champions, Neo."
"NEO","What is it?"
"TANK","Single-celled protein.  We grow it in a vat."
"MOUSE","It's not so bad, long as you don't think about liposuction."
"MORPHEUS","I want everyone on twelve-hour standby.  We're going in.  I'm taking Neo to see her."
"NEO","See who?"
"TANK","The Oracle."
"MORPHEUS","We should be back in an hour."
"MORPHEUS","Almost unbelievable, isn't it?"
"NEO","God..."
"TRINITY","What?"
"NEO","I used to eat there... Really good noodles."
"NEO","I have these memories, from my ntire life but... none of them really happened."
"NEO","What does that mean?"
"TRINITY","That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are."
"NEO","But an Oracle can."
"TRINITY","That's different."
"NEO","Is it?"
"TRINITY","Are you worried?"
"NEO","Should I be?"
"TRINITY","NO"
"NEO","Did you go to her?"
"TRINITY","Yes."
"NEO","What did she tell you?"
"TRINITY","She told me."
"NEO","What?"
"MORPHEUS","We're here.  Neo, come with me."
"CYPHER","Here we go again, eh, Trin?"
"NEO","So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?"
"MORPHEUS","Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning."
"NEO","The beginning?"
"MORPHEUS","Of the Resistance."
"NEO","And she knows what?  Everything?"
"MORPHEUS","She would say she knows enough."
"NEO","How does she know?"
"MORPHEUS","She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is."
"NEO","And she's never wrong."
"MORPHEUS","Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path."
"NEO","She helped you?"
"MORPHEUS","Yes."
"NEO","What did she tell you?"
"MORPHEUS","That I would find the One."
"MORPHEUS","I told you that I can only show you the door.  You have to step through it."
"NEO","Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea."
"MORPHEUS","Why?"
"NEO","I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?"
"MORPHEUS","What do you believe in?"
"NEO","What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus."
"MORPHEUS","That's why we're here."
"NEO","Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?"
"MORPHEUS","Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut."
"NEO","And you still believe I'm the One?"
"MORPHEUS","Yes I do."
"NEO","Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?"
"NEO","Did you believe in them too?"
"MORPHEUS","No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me."
"MORPHEUS","I believed that all I had to do was point my finger and anoint whoever I chose.  I was wrong, Neo. Terribly wrong.  Not a day or night passes that I do not think of them. After the fifth, I lost my way.  I doubted everything the Oracle had said.  I doubted myself."
"MORPHEUS","And then I saw you, on the Net, searching for me and everything changed.  I felt this charge, this electricity through my whole body. I started laughing and tears poured out of my eyes, because I knew, I knew that you were the One."
"MORPHEUS","Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world."
"NEO","Morpheus, I don't know "
"MORPHEUS","I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me."
"NEO","All right."
"PRIESTESS (WOMAN)","Hello, Neo.  You're right on time."
"PRIESTESS","Make yourself at home, Morpheus."
"MORPHEUS","Thank you."
"PRIESTESS","Neo, come with me."
"PRIESTESS","These are the other Potentials.  You can wait here."
"SPOON BOY (SKINNY BOY)","Do not try to bend the spoon.  That is impossible.  Instead, only try to realize the truth."
"NEO","What truth?"
"SPOON BOY","That there is no spoon."
"NEO","There is no spoon."
"SPOON BOY","Then you will see that it is not the spoon that bends.  It is only yourself."
"PRIESTESS","The Oracle will see you now."
"ORACLE","Just come on in."
"NEO","Hello?"
"ORACLE ","I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you."
"NEO","You're the Oracle?"
"ORACLE","Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?"
"NEO","Yeah"
"ORACLE","I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase."
"NEO","What vase?"
"ORACLE","That vase."
"NEO","Shit, I'm sorry."
"ORACLE","I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it."
"NEO","How did you know...?"
"ORACLE","What's really going to bake your noodle later on is, would you still have broken it if I hadn't said anything."
"ORACLE","You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you."
"NEO","Who?"
"ORACLE","Not too bright though"
"ORACLE","You know why Morpheus brought you to see me?"
"ORACLE","So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?"
"NEO","Honestly?  I don't know."
"ORACLE","You know what that means?  It's latin.  Means, 'Know Thyself'.  I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Being the One is just like being in love.  Nobody can tell you you're in love.  You just know it.  Through and through.  Balls to bones."
"ORACLE","Well, I better have a look at you."
"ORACLE","Open your mouth.  Say 'ahh'."
"ORACLE","Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say"
"NEO","But what?"
"ORACLE","But you already know what I'm going to tell you."
"NEO","I'm not the One."
"ORACLE","Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something."
"NEO","What?"
"ORACLE","Your next life, maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go"
"ORACLE","What's funny?"
"NEO","Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced."
"ORACLE","I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One."
"NEO","What do you mean, without him?"
"ORACLE","Are you sure you want to hear this?"
"ORACLE","Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours."
"NEO","What?"
"ORACLE","You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand, you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one, will be up to you"
"ORACLE","I'm sorry, kiddo.  I really am.  You have a good soul and I hate giving good people bad news.  But don't worry, as soon as you walk outside that door, you'll start feeling better.  You'll remember that you don't believe any of this fate crap. You're in control of your own life, remember?"
"ORACLE","Here, take a cookie.  I promise by the time you're done eating it, you'll feel right as rain."
"MORPHEUS","There is a rule that no one can ask what the Oracle said to you.  What was said was said for you and you alone."
"MORPHEUS","I can see it in your eyes, that you are still confused.  That's all right, Neo.  Give it time, let it all sink in.  I know it can be difficult to see the path even when it's right under your feet."
"MORPHEUS","Let's go."
"TRINITY","Are you all right?"
"NEO","right as rain."
"SWITCH","Weird"
"APOC","What?"
"SWITCH","That's the third white van I've seen."
"APOC","Should Tank I.D. it?"
"SWITCH","No.  Here they come"
"MOUSE","Welcome to Movie-Phone"
"TANK ","They're on their way."
"TANK","What is that...?"
"NEO","Whoa.  Deja vu"
"TANK","Oh shit!  Oh shit!"
"TRINITY","What did you just say?"
"NEO","Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu."
"TRINITY","What happened?  What did you see?"
"NEO","A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it."
"TRINITY","How much like it?  Was it the same cat?"
"NEO","It might have been.  I'm not sure."
"NEO","What is it?"
"TRINITY","A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something."
"TANK","It's a trap!"
"MORPHEUS","Come on!"
"TANK ","They cut the hardline!  It's a trap! Get out!"
"MOUSE","Oh no"
"TANK","No, no, no."
"CYPHER","That's what they changed.  We're trapped.  There's no way out."
"MORPHEUS","Give me your phone."
"TRINITY","They'll be able to track it."
"MORPHEUS","We have no choice"
"MORPHEUS ","Tank, find a structural drawing of this building and find it fast."
"TANK","Got it."
"MORPHEUS ","I need the main wet-wall."
"TANK ","Now left and that's it in front of you"
"MORPHEUS","Good"
"AGENT SMITH","Eighth floor.  They're on the eighth floor"
"AGENT BROWN","Where are they?"
"COP","They're in the walls!"
"NEO","Fuck"
"TRINITY","It's an Agent!"
"TRINITY","Morpheus!"
"MORPHEUS","Trinity, you must get Neo out.  Do you understand?  He is all that matters."
"NEO","No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!"
"MORPHEUS","Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!"
"AGENT SMITH","The sewers.  Of course."
"MORPHEUS","Hurry!"
"AGENT SMITH","They won't make it"
"TRINITY","Go!"
"NEO","We can't leave him!"
"TRINITY","We have to!"
"TRINITY","Come on!"
"AGENT SMITH","The great Morpheus.  We meet at last."
"MORPHEUS","Smith.  I am Agent Smith."
"MORPHEUS","You all look the same to me."
"AGENT SMITH","Take him."
"TANK","No!"
"AGENT JONES","We have them now."
"TRINITY","We need a phone."
"TANK","We gotta find the others.  They're still alive."
"TANK","Operator"
"CYPHER ","I need an exit!  Fast!"
"TANK","Cypher?"
"CYPHER","There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me"
"TANK ","I got you."
"CYPHER","Just get me outta here"
"TANK ","Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store."
"TANK","Operator"
"TRINITY ","Tank, it's me"
"NEO","Is Morpheus alive?"
"TRINITY","Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?"
"TANK ","Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet."
"TRINITY","He's alive"
"TRINITY","We need an exit!"
"TANK ","You're not far from Cypher."
"TRINITY","Cypher, I thought "
"TANK ","So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie."
"TRINITY","Got it."
"TANK","Got him."
"SWITCH","God, I love that sound."
"CYPHER","Shit"
"DOZER","No!"
"TRINITY","You first, Neo."
"TRINITY","What happened?"
"NEO","I don't know.  It just went dead."
"CYPHER ","Hello, Trinity."
"TRINITY","Cypher?  Where's Tank?"
"CYPHER ","He had an accident."
"TRINITY","An accident?!"
"CYPHER","You know, for a long time, I thought I was in love with you, Trinity.  I used to dream about you..."
"CYPHER","You are a beautiful woman. Too bad things had to work out like this."
"TRINITY","You killed them."
"APOC","What"
"SWITCH","Oh, God."
"CYPHER","I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired ofthis war, I'm tired of fighting.I'm tired of this ship, of beingcold, of eating the same fuckinggoop every day.  But most of all,I'm tired of this jagoff and all ofhis bullshit."
"TRINITY","My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus."
"CYPHER","Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix."
"TRINITY","The Matrix isn't real!"
"CYPHER","Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die."
"CYPHER","You tell me which is more real."
"TRINITY","But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back."
"CYPHER","That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream."
"CYPHER","Welcome to the real world, eh, baby?"
"TRINITY","Goddamn you, Cypher!"
"CYPHER","Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you."
"CYPHER","If Morpheus was right, then there's no way I can pull this plug, is there?"
"CYPHER","If he is the One, then in the next few seconds there has to be some kind of miracle to stop me.  Right? How can he be the One if he's dead?"
"CYPHER","You never did answer me, Trinity, when I asked you before.  Did you buy Morpheus' bullshit?  Come on. You can tell me, did you?  All I want is a little yes or no.  Look into his eyes, Trinity, those pretty blue eyes and tell me the truth. Yes or no."
"TRINITY","...yes"
"CYPHER","No!"
"CYPHER","I don't believe it!"
"TANK","Believe it or not, you piece of shit, you're still going to burn."
"NEO","Go.  You first this time."
"TRINITY","Tank, you're hurt."
"TRINITY","Dozer?"
"TRINITY","I'm sorry, Tank."
"AGENT SMITH","Have you ever stood and stared at it, Morpheus?  Marveled at its beauty.  Its genius.  Billions of people just living out their lives... oblivious."
"AGENT SMITH","Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world?  Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy.  It was a disaster.  No one would accept the program.  Entire crops were lost."
"AGENT SMITH","Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world.  But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery"
"AGENT SMITH","The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.  Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this:  the peak of your civilization."
"AGENT SMITH","I say 'your civilization' because as soon as we started thinking for you, it really became our civilization, which is, of course, what this is all about."
"AGENT SMITH","Evolution, Morpheus.  Evolution."
"AGENT SMITH","Like the dinosaur.  Look out that window.  You had your time."
"AGENT SMITH","The future of your world, Morpheus. The future is our time."
"AGENT SMITH","Double the dosage."
"AGENT JONES","We could have a problem."
"NEO","They're hacking his mind."
"NEO","How?"
"TANK","They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time."
"NEO","How much time?"
"TANK","Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this."
"TANK","When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know."
"NEO","What do they want?"
"TANK","Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside.Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything."
"TANK","We can't let that happen, Trinity. Zion has to be protected."
"AGENT SMITH","Never send a human to do a machine's job."
"AGENT BROWN","If, indeed, Reagan had failed, they will sever the connection as soon as possible, unless --"
"AGENT JONES","They are dead.  In either case --"
"AGENT SMITH","We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately."
"TRINITY","Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!"
"NEO","There has to be something that we can do."
"TANK","There is.  We have to pull the plug."
"TRINITY","You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!"
"TANK","Trinity, we don't have any other choice."
"TANK","Morpheus, you were more than our leader.  You were... our father.  We will miss you, always."
"NEO","Stop!"
"NEO","Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!"
"TANK","Neo, this has to be done!"
"NEO","Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?"
"TANK","What are you talking about?"
"NEO","The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me..."
"NEO","That I would have to make a choice..."
"TRINITY","What choice?"
"TRINITY","What are you doing?"
"NEO","I'm going in after him."
"TRINITY","You can't!"
"NEO","I have to."
"TRINITY","Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!"
"NEO","Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not."
"TRINITY","What?"
"NEO","I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too."
"TRINITY","No, you... have to be."
"NEO","I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters."
"TRINITY","No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true."
"NEO","Why?"
"TRINITY","Because..."
"TANK","Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide."
"NEO","I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go."
"TANK","Why?"
"NEO","Because I believe in something."
"TRINITY","What?"
"NEO","I believe I can bring him back."
"NEO","What are you doing?"
"TRINITY","I'm coming with you."
"NEO","No, you're not."
"TRINITY","No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else."
"TRINITY","Tank, load us up."
"AGENT SMITH","I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here.  It came to me when I tried to classify your species.  I've realized that you are not actually mammals."
"AGENT SMITH","Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment.  But you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area."
"AGENT SMITH","There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.  Do you know what is?  A virus."
"AGENT SMITH","Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet.  You are a plague. And we are... the cure."
"TANK","Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle..."
"TRINITY","No one has ever done anything like this."
"NEO","Yeah?"
"NEO","That's why it's going to work."
"AGENT SMITH","Why isn't the serum working?"
"AGENT BROWN","Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions."
"AGENT SMITH","Leave me with him."
"AGENT SMITH","Now!"
"AGENT SMITH","Can you hear me, Morpheus?  I'm going to be honest with you."
"AGENT SMITH","I hate this place.  This zoo.  This prison.  This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer.  It's the smell, if there is such a thing.  I feel saturated by it.  I can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it."
"AGENT SMITH","Repulsive, isn't it?"
"AGENT SMITH","I must get out of here, I must get free.  In this mind is the key.  My key."
"AGENT SMITH","Once Zion is destroyed, there is no need for me to be here.  Do you understand?  I need the codes.  I have to get inside Zion.  You have to tell me how."
"AGENT SMITH","You are going to tell me or you are going to die."
"TANK","Hold on, Morpheus.  They're coming for you.  They're coming."
"GUARD","Would you please remove any metallic items you are carrying:  keys, loose change "
"GUARD","Holy shit "
"AGENT BROWN","What were you doing?"
"AGENT JONES","You don't know."
"AGENT SMITH","Know what?"
"AGENT JONES","I think they're trying to save him."
"NEO","There is no spoon."
"AGENT JONES","Lower level "
"AGENT BROWN","They are actually attacking."
"AGENT SMITH","Find them and destroy them!"
"PILOT","I repeat, we are under attack!"
"NEO","Trinity!"
"NEO","... help."
"AGENT JONES","Only human..."
"TRINITY","Dodge this, mutherfucker!"
"TRINITY","Neo, how did you do that?"
"NEO","Do what?"
"TRINITY","You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast."
"NEO","It wasn't fast enough."
"TRINITY","Are you all right?"
"NEO","I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving."
"NEO","Can you fly that thing."
"TRINITY","Not yet."
"TANK","Operator."
"TRINITY","Let's go."
"SERGEANT","Sir!  Sir!  There was gunfire -- we've lost communication with the roof!"
"AGENT JONES","Remain at your posts."
"SERGEANT","But, sir -- the fire -- we should evacuate!"
"AGENT JONES","You will do as you are ordered!"
"AGENT SMITH","No."
"NEO","Get up, Morpheus!  Get up!"
"AGENT SMITH","Nooo!"
"NEO","He won't make it."
"NEO","Gotcha!"
"TANK","He is the One.  He's gotta be... but why?  He's gotta be!"
"AGENT SMITH","Find them!  Track them!"
"TRINITY","Morpheus!"
"MORPHEUS","Do you believe it now, Trinity?"
"NEO","Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me "
"MORPHEUS","She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path."
"TANK","Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!"
"TANK","Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo."
"AGENT SMITH","Damnit!"
"AGENT BROWN","The trace was completed."
"AGENT JONES","We have their position."
"AGENT BROWN","The extermination unit is in place."
"AGENT JONES","Order the strike."
"AGENT SMITH","They're not out yet."
"NEO","Let's go!  You first, Morpheus."
"TRINITY","Neo, I have to tell you something. I don't know what it means or even if it matters but I feel I have to say it."
"TRINITY","I've never told anyone this before. I think I've been afraid to."
"TRINITY","When I went to the Oracle, she told me... she told me that I would meet a man.  And that I would fall in love..."
"NEO","Promise me you'll tell me the rest?"
"NEO","No!"
"TRINITY","Neo!"
"TANK","What the hell just happened?"
"TRINITY","An Agent!  You have to send me back!"
"TANK","I can't!"
"AGENT SMITH","Mr. Anderson."
"TRINITY","Run, Neo.  Run."
"TRINITY","What is he doing?"
"MORPHEUS","He's beginning to believe."
"AGENT SMITH","You're empty."
"NEO","So are you."
"AGENT SMITH","I'm going to enjoy watching you die, Mr. Anderson."
"TRINITY","Jesus, he's killing him!"
"AGENT SMITH","Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?"
"AGENT SMITH","That is the sound of inevitability."
"AGENT SMITH","It is the sound of your death."
"AGENT SMITH","Good-bye, Mr. Anderson."
"NEO","My name is Neo."
"TRINITY","What just happened?"
"TANK","I don't know.  I lost him."
"MORPHEUS","He's on the run --"
"TANK","Oh shit!"
"TRINITY","Oh no."
"TRINITY","How long?"
"MORPHEUS","Five minutes.  Maybe six."
"MORPHEUS","Tank, charge the E.M.P."
"TRINITY","You can't use that until Neo is out!"
"MORPHEUS","I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it."
"MAN","What the shit -- My phone!"
"TANK","Operator."
"NEO","Hurry, Tank!  I got some serious pursuit!"
"TRINITY","Neo, you better get your ass back here!"
"NEO","I'm trying, Trinity.  I'm trying."
"TANK","I got a patch on an old exit. Wabash and Lake.  A hotel.  Room 303."
"NEO","Which way?  Which way?"
"TANK","No!  Not down there!"
"NEO","Uh, help!  Need a little help!"
"TANK","That door on your left."
"NEO","It's locked."
"TANK","Shit!  The door on your left."
"TANK","No!  Other left!"
"TANK","Down!  Down!"
"TANK","That's it!  You're almost there! That fire escape at the end of the alley!"
"TANK","I'm going to make the call."
"MORPHEUS","Do it!"
"TRINITY","No."
"MORPHEUS","Here they come."
"MORPHEUS","He's going to make it."
"TANK","They've burned through the outer shields."
"TRINITY","Hurry, Neo."
"MORPHEUS","No, it can't be.  It can't be."
"AGENT SMITH","Check him."
"TRINITY","Neo..."
"AGENT BROWN","He's gone."
"AGENT SMITH","Good-bye, Mr. Anderson."
"TRINITY","Neo, please, listen to me.  I promised to tell you the rest.  The Oracle, she told me that I'd fall in love and that man, the man I loved would be the One.  You see?  You can't be dead, Neo, you can't be because I love you.  You hear me?  I love you!"
"TRINITY","Now get up!"
"NEO","No!"
"TANK","How...?!"
"MORPHEUS","He is the One.  He is the One!"
"TRINITY","Neo!"
"TRINITY","Now!"
"TRINITY","Neo?"
